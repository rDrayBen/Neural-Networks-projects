# Neural-Networks-projects

Here are my neural networks projects made for corresponding uni course

NN1 file provides Linear Regression and DNN with grid search for the best parameters using pytorch and cuda.

NN2 file provides CNN, frozen Resnet and fine-tuned Resnet with Caltech101 dataset(provided in the corresponding folder) using pytorch and cuda.

NN3 file provides transformers and recursive NN training, particularly RNN, LSTM, GRU models from scratch, GPT2 and BERT models pretrained using keras(first 3) and pytorch(last 2).

NN4 file provides time series training for BFO stock(provided in files) using Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, LSTM+DNN, 1D-CNN-LSTM-DNN using keras.
